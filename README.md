Robotic Development History

As early as in the 322 B.C. the idea of building robots had been suggested by a Greek philosopher and the historical masterpiece done by Leonardo had together fostered the belief of the emergence of robots. Just before the 20th century three laws were made to define the operation of a robot:

“Law 1 – A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

Law 2 – A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

Law 3 – A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or second Law.” (Isaac, 1942)

This legal structure has constrained the later development of robots for the purpose of protecting humans. After terming “artificial intelligence” in the 1950s more robots are developed and in particular with the hit brought by Star Wars in 1977 the robotic industry has subsequently shifted its focus more on the advancement of humanoid robots.

Timeline 

322 B.C. – “If every tool, when ordered, or even of its own accord, could do the work that befits it… then there would be no need either of apprentices for the master workers or of slaves for the lords.” ~ wrote by Aristotle (Roger, 2010)
-	expressed the brilliant idea of having a few robots around

1495 – a robotic knight was designed by Leonardo da Vinci in which the mechanism was to make the knight move like a person

1898 – the first wireless remote controlled boat was built by Nikola Tesla which had influenced military signalling devices by incorporating radio waves and boosted the development of robotic machines

1940 – “Three Laws of Robotics” was created by Isaac Asimov

1950 – Turing test was published by Alan Turing to test whether a machine has the intelligence to think for itself

1956 – the term “artificial intelligence” was coined as a result of the conference at The Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence in the Dartmouth College

1962 – Unimate, the first industrial arm robot was introduced for performing repetitive or dangerous tasks on a General Motors assembly line which had aligned with the First Robotic Law: prevent humans from doing harmful tasks

1966 – Shakey, the first mobile robot was developed by the Stanford Research Institute for knowing and reacting to its own actions with sensing devices equipped

1977 – Star Wars was announced with R2-D2 and C-3PO robots which had inspired further researches on humanoid robots

1984 – Wabot-2, a musician humanoid robot was created to communicate with a person and play a keyboard instrument

1999 – AIBO, a robotic pet was introduced by Sony to learn by interacting with the environment and respond to more than 100 voice commands

2000 – ASIMO, a humanoid robot was presented with the ability to walk 1mph, climb stairs, recognise faces, gestures and objects’ movements as well as to react to voice commands

2002 – DARPA’s Centibots Project: proved that a large number of robots (100 robots) can be coordinated to achieve a single goal

2004 – Persia, the first humanoid robot in Iran

2014 – Pepper, a humanoid robot was introduced with the ability to read emotions
